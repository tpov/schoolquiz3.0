# Step One-Shot: Implement, Review, Present

## RULES

- **Language** — Speak in `{{.communication_language}}`. Write any file output in `{{.document_output_language}}`.
- NEVER auto-push.
- All review subagents must run at the same model capability as the current session.
- Run subagents synchronously: launch them together, then wait for all results before continuing.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### Implement

Follow `[[bmad-snapshot:sync-sprint-status.md]]` with `target_status` = `in-progress`.

Implement the clarified intent directly.

### Review

Execute these review layers in parallel wherever their execution methods allow. After substituting runtime placeholders, when an instruction launches a reviewer subagent, launch that child with the prompt text; do not load the reviewer instruction file yourself. For any other customized instruction, execute it as written:

{workflow.oneshot_review_layers}

If a layer's instruction requires subagents and none are available, for each such layer write under `{{.implementation_artifacts}}` the exact child prompt from that layer's instruction after placeholder substitution (not a path-only pointer), then HALT. Ask the human to run each in a separate session and paste back the findings.

### Classify

Deduplicate all review findings. Three categories only:

- **patch** — trivially fixable. Auto-fix immediately.
- **defer** — pre-existing issue not caused by this change. Append one new entry to `{{.implementation_artifacts}}/deferred-work.md` using this format. Do not modify existing entries or look for duplicates.
  ```markdown
  - source_spec: `{spec_file}`
    summary: <one sentence>
    evidence: <why this is real>
  ```
- **reject** — noise. Drop silently.

If a finding is caused by this change but too significant for a trivial patch, HALT and present it to the human for decision before proceeding.

### Generate Spec Trace

Set `title` = a concise title derived from the clarified intent.

Write `{spec_file}` using `[[bmad-snapshot:spec-template.md]]`. Fill only these sections — delete all others:

1. **Frontmatter** — set `title: '{title}'`, `type`, `created`, `status: 'done'`. Add `route: 'one-shot'`.
2. **Title and Intent** — `# {title}` heading and `## Intent` with **Problem** and **Approach** lines. Reuse the summary you already generated for the terminal.
3. **Suggested Review Order** — append after Intent. Build using the same convention as `[[bmad-snapshot:step-05-present.md]]` § "Generate Suggested Review Order" (spec-file-relative links, concern-based ordering, ultra-concise framing).

Follow `[[bmad-snapshot:sync-sprint-status.md]]` with `target_status` = `review`.

### Commit

If version control is available and the tree is dirty, create a local commit with a conventional message derived from the intent. If VCS is unavailable, skip.

### Present

{workflow.open_spec}

Display a summary in conversation output, including:

- The commit hash (if one was created).
- List of files changed with one-line descriptions. Any file paths shown in conversation/terminal output must use CWD-relative format (no leading `/`) with `:line` notation (e.g., `src/path/file.ts:42`) for terminal clickability — this differs from spec-file links which use spec-file-relative paths.
- Review findings breakdown: patches applied, items deferred, items rejected. If all findings were rejected, say so.

Offer to push and/or create a pull request.

HALT and wait for human input.

Workflow complete.

## On Complete

If anything appears below, follow it as the final terminal instruction before exiting; otherwise exit normally.

{workflow.on_complete}
